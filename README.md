# Fake News Detection using Machine Learning

## Overview

This project focuses on building a machine learning model for detecting fake news. The dataset used in this project is a combination of various sources, including news articles and headlines from different platforms. The goal is to train and evaluate multiple machine learning models to identify patterns and features that distinguish between real and fake news.

## Datasets Used

1. **Dataset1:** A dataset containing news articles with labels indicating whether they are real or fake.
2. **Dataset2:** Combines true and fake news articles from different sources.
3. **Dataset3:** Politifact dataset consisting of real and fake news articles.
4. **Dataset4:** Another dataset with labeled news articles.
5. **Dataset5:** A dataset combining headlines and body text with corresponding labels.

## Data Preprocessing

The preprocessing steps include text cleaning, combining relevant columns, and applying word processing techniques to prepare the data for model training. This involves removing special characters, hyperlinks, and stopwords.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The project includes exploratory data analysis using word clouds to visualize the most frequent words in both real and fake news articles from different datasets.

## Machine Learning Models

Several machine learning models are implemented for classification:

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier
- Gradient Boosting Classifier
- XGBoost Classifier
- Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier
- Bernoulli Naive Bayes Classifier

## Model Evaluation

Each model is trained and evaluated using accuracy metrics on a test dataset. The results are included to showcase the performance of each algorithm in the context of fake news detection.

## Instructions for Use

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your_username/fake-news-detection.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to train and evaluate the models.
